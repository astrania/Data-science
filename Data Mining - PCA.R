# Principal Component Analysis on Leuk Error
# Dear Ms. Peceay,
# We are happy you reached out. Upon reviewing the data you provided to us, 
# we have some good news for you. After running principal components analysis, 
# our team identified some samples that look unusual. As you begin your 
# investigation of the possible mislabeled samples, we recommend that you 
# start with testing samples 19 and 2, respectively.
# Sample 19 is labeled as AML, but according to our analysis, it is most similar to the ALL-T samples. 
# Sample 2, labeled as AML, is similar to the ALL â€“ B samples. 
# The mislabeled sample is likely to be one of those samples.
# We are confident that in following our recommendation, you will not only 
# save money and time, but will be able to rest assured that our procedures 
# should get you on the right track to meet your project delivery date on time.
# Please let us know if there is anything else we can assist you with.
